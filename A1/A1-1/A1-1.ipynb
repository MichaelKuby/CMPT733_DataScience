    "* How to download HTML pages from a website?\n",
    "* How to extract relevant content from an HTML page? \n",

    "1. Please use [pandas.DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) rather than spark.DataFrame to manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Please follow the python code style (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). If TA finds your code hard to read, you will lose points. This requirement will stay for the whole semester."
