    "\n",
    "Causal inference is the process of drawing a conclusion about a causal connection based on the conditions of the occurrence of an effect. It is a very powerful and widely-used tool in real-world applications and scenarios. In this assignment, you are expected to apply the basic concepts of causal inference to solve problems on real datasets and be able to achieve the following goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand why causality is needed.\n",
    "* Understand what is causality, particularly the difference between causality and correlation.\n",
    "* Understand how to estimate counterfactual results.\n",
    "* Understand how to use the graphical model to represent causality.\n",
    "* Can use some tools (e.g., dowhy) to infer causality, express causality and estimate treatment effects."

    "1. <u>Perfect Matching</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Advantage*: Perfect matching is very easy to understand. Given two records that have identical features except for their treatment, we can directly infer counterfactuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Advantage*: Accuracy. It would seem that since the two records have identical features outside of their treatment, the counterfactual computed should be very accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Disadvantage*: Few matches. For most datasets, perfect matching is unlikely to generate a proportionally large number of matches since finding a record in the treatment data that is identical is uncommon, and will become increasingly uncommon the more features we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <u>Nearest Neighbour</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Advantage*: More matches. Because it finds matches that are close, but not perfect, it has the flexibility of being able to compute many more counterfactuals than Perfect Matching is able to.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Disadvantage*: Potentially inaccurate. Depending on the metric used to compute the distance between records and the matches that are created, it is possible to end up computing counterfactuals that are inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <u>Propensity Score Matching</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Advantage*: Simplicity through dimensionality reduction. By using a single feature to identify matches that is computed based on each of the original features, PSM is effectively doing dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
